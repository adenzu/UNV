# Unmanned Naval Vehicle: Autonomous Boat Control Simulation

## Project Description

The Unmanned Naval Vehicle project addresses the challenge of autonomous maneuver control for boats, focusing on optimizing criteria such as travel time, fuel consumption, and safety. The simulation environment provides a realistic setting for testing various algorithms and technologies, offering a solution to the complexities of autonomous boat navigation.

## Key Features

- Realistic simulation of maritime environments.
- Pathfinding algorithms for determining optimal routes between two points.
- Utilization of Bezier curves for smooth path tracking.
- Integration of Fuzzy Logic (Fuzzy Adaptive Model - FAM) for decision-making.
- Application of L-BFGS-B optimizations for enhanced performance.
- Dynamic obstacle avoidance during path tracking.

## Installation

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Install Unity (at least 2022.3.4f1) on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Open the project with Unity.

## Usage

The current version of the simulation is not designed for external use. It serves as a research and development tool for autonomous boat control as of **now**.

## Dependencies

All necessary assets are included in the repository, eliminating the need for external dependencies.
